ISMS Implementation and Audit Project
Overview
This project documents the comprehensive design, implementation, evaluation, and auditing of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) for Bluefrontier Bank. It aligns with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard and integrates COBIT 2019 framework practices. The project delivers a detailed roadmap for achieving and maintaining a secure, compliant, and risk-managed information environment within a banking context.

Current State Assessment: Security posture evaluated through COBIT mapping and vulnerability testing

Future State Design: Goals set based on gap analysis and COBIT 2019 priority setting

Action Planning: Initiatives planned with business justification and stakeholder involvement

Implementation: Technical control deployment, training, and policy development

Performance Monitoring: KPIs tracked, internal audits conducted, and ISMS evaluated

Sustainability Planning: Continuous improvement processes, stakeholder engagement, and audit follow-up

Planning Phase: Defined scope and risk-based priorities

Fieldwork Phase: Conducted document reviews, gap analyses, and compliance checks

Reporting Phase: Documented findings, recommended improvements, and reviewed implementation progress

Standards Applied
ISO/IEC 27001: Provided the core structure and control objectives
